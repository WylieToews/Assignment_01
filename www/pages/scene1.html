                        <p>Waking up from a deep sleep you stand up to notice that you are not where you used to be.. Wait.. you donâ€™t remember where you were before you went to sleep. Standing up you take in your surroundings. You stand outside a small white house with a perfect picket fence. In front of you stands the mailbox and a path leading towards the house. You have no idea why you are here nor how you got here, all you know is that you are here now. You see a faint glow emanating in one of the windows of the house in front of you.</p>
