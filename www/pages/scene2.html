                        <p>Walking towards the house you notice the door is open slightly and from that crack in the door you can smell a pungent odor from inside. Stepping through the doorway you see what is making the smell, a disgustingly messy house. The house itself possess a distinct lack of any decor, it looks like this house was decorated with hand-me-down furniture. Scanning through the small house you see the same light you saw outside coming from a side room in the house.</p>
