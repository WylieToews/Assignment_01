                        <p>Entering the doorway into a oddly clean room in which the light was spilling out of you see what was casting the light. A computer. The computer sits upon a desk with nothing out of order on it, a notepad sits next to the mouse with some strange doodling on it. Tucked neatly under the desk is a chair that looks like it was made out of the most comfy materials known to man. It seems to draw you in the more you look at it. </p>
